# Spam Detection Model

## Spam Detection System

This project is a **Spam Detection System** that leverages advanced machine learning models to classify text inputsâ€”including **SMS, Emails, and YouTube Comments**â€”as spam or not spam.

The system is built with a **Node.js backend**, which seamlessly integrates **Python-based machine learning models** for accurate predictions. It utilizes our **advanced URL classification model** to extract and analyze URLs separately from the text, assessing their legitimacy before combining the results for a more robust spam detection process.

A frontend interface is also included, allowing users to interact with the system and receive real-time classification results.

## Models

The project employs separate machine learning models optimized for different types of spam classification located in `models/`.

### SMS Spam Model

- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Features: TF-IDF vectorization (unigrams and bigrams)
- Dataset: SMS spam dataset
- Model File: `models/sms/sms_model.pkl`

### Email Spam Model

- Algorithm: Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
- Features: TF-IDF vectorization
- Dataset: Email spam dataset
- Model File: `models/email/email_model.pkl`

### YouTube Comment Spam Model

- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Features: Word embeddings with TF-IDF
- Dataset: YouTube comment spam dataset
- Model File: `models/comment/comment_model.pkl`

### URL Spam Model

- Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier
- Features: Extracted URL characteristics such as length, domain type, special characters, and presence of certain keywords.
- Dataset: URL spam dataset
- Model File: `models/url/url_model.pkl`

Each model is pre-trained and saved in the respective directories for easy integration with the backend API.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- pip (latest version)

### Installation Steps

**1.** Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detection-model.git
cd spam-detection
```

**2.** Backend Setup

```
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

**3.** Normalize the data

```
python tools/normalize_data.py
```

**4.** Train the models

```
python/url/train_url_model.py
python/comment/train_comment_model.py
python/sms/train_sms_model.py
python/email/train_email_model.py
```

**5.** Run the backend

```
node backend/index.js
```

**6.** Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

## Usage

Once the backend server is running, you can use the frontend interface or make API requests directly.

### Running the Frontend

Simply open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Making API Requests

You can also send requests to the API endpoints via Postman or curl.

Example:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/predict-sms -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Win a free iPhone now!"}'
```

Response:

```
{
    "spam_prob": 0.41,
    "url_spam_prob": 0.0,
    "combined_prob": 0.41,
    "is_spam": false
}
```
